Question No : 1 
You have multiple arrays containing student grades for different subjects. You want to merge these arrays and calculate the average grade for each student. Write a function that takes these arrays as input and returns an array with the average grades.

Input format :

The first line of input contains the number of students (numStudents).

The second line of input contains the number of subjects (numSubjects).

The next numStudents lines contain numSubjects, space-separated grades for each student.

Output format :

The output displays the average grades for each student.

Each line of output contains the average grade for a student in the format "Student [student_number]: [average_grade]" with a round off one digit.




Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :

1 <= numStudents <= 100 (maximum number of students)

1 <= numSubjects <= 100 (maximum number of subjects)

The grades are real numbers.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
2
4
70 80 90 100
60 80 100 70
Output 1 :
Average grades:
Student 1: 85.0
Student 2: 77.5

Input 2 :
3
4
80 90 75 85
70 65 80 75
90 85 95 92
Output 2 :
Average grades:
Student 1: 82.5
Student 2: 72.5
Student 3: 90.5

Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
